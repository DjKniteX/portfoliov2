        <p>My name is Nikki Xaysanasy and I am originally from Arkansas. I decided to move to California to pursue a career as a Developer.
          I am familiar with many different technologies which I learned throughout my career both freelancing and through professional work. I am always constantly learning
          and trying to keep up with the current trends. When I'm not programming or developing websites, I am reading, learning new recipies and playing my Nintendo Switch.
        </p>

        <p>I landed my current gig due to a friend of mine who is also a co-worker that referred me to the job. I have little knowledge of testing but with this job I was able
          to learn more about QA as well as end-to-end testing.

        <h6>System Analyst</h6>
        <h6>Sep 2018 - Present</h6>
        <p>My current position after ZAM. It's not a full time development gig but it's more of a technical support. I am hoping I can work full-time as a Developer but I was able
          to help with the Front-End design on their latest product that they are working on. I learned basic SQL and help write documentation for their API. I'm hoping to take what I learn here with me towards
          a career in Web Development or Software Engineering.
        </p>

        <p>Shortly after arriving in California, I landed an internship with ZAM Network. They owned many of the fansites for big games including World of Warcraft and League of Legends.
          I started as a DevOps Intern rather than a Web Dev one but I learned a lot awhile I was there. I would say this was the job that inspired me to learn more in Computer Science.

          <ul>
          <li>Learned the basics of DevOps</li>
